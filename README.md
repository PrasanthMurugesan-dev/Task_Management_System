Welcome to My Task management system

Objective :
Build a full-stack Todo Task Management Web Application that allows users to sign in using social logins (Google, GitHub, Facebook) and manage their personal and shared tasks. Users should be able to perform full CRUD operations, filter tasks, and collaborate with others by sharing tasks. The app should support real-time updates, responsive design, and user-friendly UI/UX. The goal is to showcase your complete engineering skillsâ€”from authentication, API design, and database modeling to realtime communication, cloud deployment, and DevOps best practices.
